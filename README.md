# Overview

Here, I share my attempts at implementing from scratch and reproducing the results of some of the research papers that I've read, documenting the process and sharing it with the community. Please note that since this is not an official implementation, there are likely bugs and inaccuracies. However, I hope that you find this repository to be a helpful learning resource.

## Content

You will find various projects, each one focusing on reproducing the results of a specific research paper. Each project includes the original paper, highlighted for a quicker read, the code used to implement the paper and in future projects, you'll find figures, metrics and trained weights for a more complete and better understanding of the papers.

## Usage

Feel free to use this page as a learning resource. You can use the code as a starting point for your own projects or as a reference to understand the concepts discussed in the papers.
